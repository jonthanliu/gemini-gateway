**[English](README.md) | [‰∏≠Êñá](README.zh.md)**

An intelligent AI gateway that supercharges your applications by providing a unified API for Google's Gemini models, complete with load balancing, failover, and a user-friendly management dashboard.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Unified API Interface**: Access Gemini models through multiple API formats, including **OpenAI**, **Anthropic**, and native **Gemini** protocols.
- **Smart Load Balancing**: Intelligently distributes requests across a pool of Gemini API keys to maximize throughput.
- **Automatic Failover**: Automatically retries failed requests with the next available key, ensuring high availability.
- **Persistent & Dynamic**: Manage API keys, authentication, and configurations on-the-fly through a web UI without service restarts.
- **Secure & Scalable**: Built with security in mind, ready for production deployment with Docker.
- **Management Dashboard**: A sleek dashboard to monitor usage, manage keys, and configure the gateway in real-time.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Database**: SQLite (with Drizzle ORM)
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI
- **Containerization**: Docker

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Self-Hosting with Docker (Recommended)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jonthanliu/gemini-gateway.git
    cd gemini-gateway
    ```

2.  **Configure your environment:**
    Copy the example environment file and edit it with your settings.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Now, edit the `.env` file:
    ```env
    # --- Security (Mandatory) ---
    # Set a strong, random password here for the admin panel.
    AUTH_TOKEN="your_super_secret_admin_token"

    # A comma-separated list of tokens your clients will use.
    ALLOWED_TOKENS="client_token_1,client_token_2"

    # --- Database (Do not change for Docker) ---
    DATABASE_URL="file:/app/data/prod.db"
    ```

3.  **Run with Docker Compose:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```

4.  **Access the Admin Panel:**
    - Open your browser and navigate to `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:3000/admin`.
    - Log in using the `AUTH_TOKEN` you set in the `.env` file.
    - Go to the **Keys** tab and add your Gemini API keys.

Your gateway is now live and ready to serve requests!

## üîå Client Usage Examples

Once your gateway is deployed, you can configure your favorite clients to use it. For the best experience and security, **it is highly recommended to configure your own domain name for the gateway**.

### Native Gemini Clients (Recommended)

For clients that support the Google Gemini API, this is the most direct way to configure.

#### VSCode (Cline) & CherryStudio

1.  In your client's model settings, select **Gemini** as the model provider.
2.  Set the **API Base URL** or **Endpoint** to your gateway address:
    ```
    http://<your_domain_or_server_ip>:3000
    ```
3.  Set the **API Key** to a token you created in the "Allowed API Tokens" section of the admin dashboard.

### Anthropic-Compatible Clients

For tools that use the Anthropic SDK (e.g., `claude-code`), you can point to this gateway by setting environment variables.

```bash
# Set your gateway address
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://<your_domain_or_server_ip>:3000

# Set the API token you created in the admin dashboard
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your_token>

# Now run your tool
claude
```

### OpenAI-Compatible Clients

For general-purpose clients like LobeChat or ChatGPT-Next-Web, you can use the OpenAI-compatible interface.

1.  In your client's settings, find the **OpenAI-Compatible** or **Custom Model** option.
2.  Set the **API Base URL** or **Endpoint** to:
    ```
    http://<your_domain_or_server_ip>:3000/openai/v1
    ```
3.  Set the **API Key** to one of the "Allowed API Tokens" you created in the admin dashboard.
4.  Select a model name (e.g., `gemini-pro`) and start using it.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes & Disclaimer

- **Password Recovery**: If you forget your admin password, you can edit the `AUTH_TOKEN` in your `.env` file and restart the container.
