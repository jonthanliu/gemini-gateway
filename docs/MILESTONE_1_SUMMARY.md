# Milestone 1 Summary: Core GeminiClient Implementation

## Work Completed

- **Switched to `@google/generative-ai`**: Based on user feedback and to ensure stability, we reverted from `@google/genai` to the more established `@google/generative-ai` library.
- **Implemented `GeminiClient`**: A new, robust `GeminiClient` class was implemented in `lib/core/gemini-client.ts`.
  - It encapsulates all direct communication with the Google Gemini API.
  - It includes the user-specified retry logic (60s timeout, 5s delay).
  - It integrates with `KeyService` for API key management and `LoggingService` for asynchronous logging.
  - It correctly handles streaming and non-streaming responses.
- **Created Custom Errors**: Defined `ServiceUnavailableError` and `RequestTimeoutError` for clear, standardized error handling.
- **Unit Tests**: Created a basic unit test file with mocksTimeoutError` for clear, standardized error handling.
- **Unit Tests**: Created a basic unit test file with mocks
